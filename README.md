This is a Portfolio Webpage project.  The goal here is to implement basic HTML and CSS styling with best practices in mind, and create my own four-section Portfolio webpage.

Notes: Placeholder image is intended to represent future projects.  Links to twitter and Linkedin go to the website homepage as I don't have accounts for these at time of creation.
